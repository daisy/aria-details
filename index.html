        Accessible extended descriptions: HTML documents that demonstrate usage scenarios for the
        <code>aria-details</code> attribute combined with the
        <code>details</code> (and associated <code>summary</code>) elements.
    </h1>

    <p>
        The source HTML and CSS code for this website is located in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/daisy/aria-details/tree/master

        Note that these examples do <em>not</em> represent authoritative good practices for content production. This is merely
        braintorming material to support the ongoing discussion regarding accessible extended descriptions for images and
        other complex information structures (such as HTML tables). Also note that these examples are intentionally poorly-styled
        (no fancy CSS), in order to put emphasis on structure and semantics. The goal is to express a generic model that
        provides flexibility in terms of actual aesthetics. Eventually, this research work may lead to a more formal recommendation
        for content creators / publishers.

    <p>
        The <code>details</code> (and associated <code>summary</code>) elements contain the actual description. The default
        collapsed / closed state of the <code>details</code> element means that only the <code>summary</code> "label" is
        visible. The user can choose to expand / open the <code>details</code> element in order to reveal the full description
        content (which itself may contain a hyperlink to further external content). The process of expanding / collapsing
        the <code>details</code> element is keyboard-accessible and generally well-supported in modern web browsers.
    </p>
    <p>
        When the <code>details</code> element is located immediately after the described object (e.g. immediately below an
        image), the description summary and full content are reached by simply following the linear reading order. This is
        accessible to both mainstream users (e.g. visually) and users of assistive technologies (e.g. via synthetic speech
        / screen readers). The <code>aria-details</code> attribute in the described object (e.g. the source image HTML tag
        / element) references the immediately-following <code>details</code> element, and as such provides additional semantic
        information in the accessibility tree that assistive technologies (such as screen readers) rely on to help users
        navigate content.
    </p>
    <p>
        When the <code>details</code> element is located away from the described object (e.g. at the end of the HTML document,
        in the form of a "footnote" ), simply following the linear reading order is not an adequate user experience. Instead,
        there must be a link to allow the user to jump from the described object into the description, and there must be
        a "link back" mechanism in order to resume reading from the described object. Because the
        <code>aria-details</code> attribute is only exposed to users of assistive technologies, there must be an additional
        "fallback" affordance (such as a regular HTML link) located near the described object. Although such link needs to
        be visible to mainstream users, it may be styled discretely to avoid cluttering the information stream. Note that
        in the case of HTML tables which are typically content-rich, it may be preferable to include a description link immediately
        before the table, rather than immediately after it. Otherwise, users would be forced to skip the entire table (rows
        and columns) in order to reach the description link.
